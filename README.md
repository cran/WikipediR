Description
======
_WikipediR_ is a wrapper around the MediaWiki API, optimised for the Wikimedia Foundation's production sites, such as Wikipedia. It is written in and for R, a statistical environment and associated programming language in heavy use by HCI researchers that, somehow, escaped having an API wrapper until now.

It is currently in development, although the functionality present (namely diff generation through wiki\_diff, user information retrieval through wiki\_userinfo and page metadata retrieval through wiki\_pagecats) works.

Limitations
======
WikipediR currently lacks:
* Quite a few possible API calls;
* Support for querying Wikidata, and;
* Direct authentication, through MediaWiki or OAuth.

With the exception of Wikidata (which will be handled by a different package, because the API works very differently), these issues will be solved in time. If there is a particular feature you want, open an issue here on github: I can't prioritise if I don't know what people are trying to do :).

Dependencies
======
* R. Doy.
* [httr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/index.html) and its dependencies, and;
* [jsonlite](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html) and its dependencies.

To-Do
======
* Look for a more elegant way of handling the parameter names in the returned JSON block;
* Introduce authentication, via both direct MediaWiki authentication and OAuth

Thanks and misc
======
Thanks to, in no particular order:

* [Adam](https://github.com/Protonk), for being the person who got me through my baby steps in R, and;
* [Hadley](https://github.com/hadley), both for httr and his wonderful API wrapper tutorial, which I have liberally stolen from, and;
* [Toby](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:TNegrin_%28WMF%29), for not firing me for working on this.

An etymological note; while a lot of people reflexively twitch at people using CamelCase in package names, the opportunity here was too good to resist. "WikipediR" is a reference both to the R convention of having package names that consist of [thing the package does] + [reference to R], and the link format in UseModWiki, the predecessor to MediaWiki, that used CamelcaseinG to indicate what the author intended to be a link (this is also where the "WikipediA" logo comes from).
